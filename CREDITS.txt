As Joomdle integrates Joomla and Moodle, it borrows code from both projects.
The same is true for other components integrated: Virtuemart, Hikashop....
Auto height in wrapper code for Moodle ported form JFusion
Installer ported from Joomfish
Includes some icons from the great icon collection Dropline Neu. For more information about the Dropline Neu, icon set, see Silvestre's website at http://www.silvestre.com.ar.
Includes code from iframe-resizer (https://github.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer from David J. Bradshaw) to provide cross-domain auto height in wrapper.
